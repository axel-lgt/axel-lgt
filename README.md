# ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·  Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Axel.

I'm a junior JavaScript front-end web developer currently based in France, who aspires to thrive in web development by building solo projects and showing what I'm capable of.

I mainly use JavaScript and ReactJS for front-end projects, but have already experienced some back-end development with Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL.

I learned web development through a French online school called [O'Clock](https://oclock.io) in which I spent 6 months from February 2021 to August 2021. Thanks to O'Clock, I learned all the different assets of FullStack development and I am no stranger to real life work environments.

I then took some time off to practice all the notions I had heard about before starting to create small projects.

Today, I am more than ever ready to express my creativity through what I find interesting in developping projects.

## My latest projects
- ðŸŽµ [**Museek**](https://github.com/axel-lgt/museek): a small project powered by the Genius website API and an Express server in order to find music lyrics.

...and many more to come!
